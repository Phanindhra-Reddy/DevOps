# Kubernetes Operators
- A Kubernetes Operator is a powerful pattern and tool used to automate the management of complex stateful applications on Kubernetes.
- Operators extend the Kubernetes API and leverage the native Kubernetes capabilities to manage application-specific tasks and lifecycle management.
- The goal of an Operator is to put operational knowledge into software.
- Operators typically provide controllers and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that let you rapidly deploy new app instances without deep knowledge of their requirements or how they work.
